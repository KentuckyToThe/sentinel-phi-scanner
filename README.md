## What This Project Taught Me:
- âœ… Why healthcare IT consultants drive Teslas
- âœ… That "just scan for SSNs" is the "just draw the rest of the owl" of HIPAA
- âœ… Regex patterns for detecting PHI: âˆž
- âœ… My regex patterns that actually work: 7... maybe

## Key Features:
- ðŸŽ¯ Catches 40% of SSNs (the other 60% are "edge cases")
- ðŸŽ¯ Only 10,000 false positives per document!
- ðŸŽ¯ Definitely won't get you sued (disclaimer: will absolutely get you sued)
- ðŸŽ¯ Works great on "Test Patient" and "John Doe"
