### Project Overview
A Python-based tool designed to identify potential Protected Health Information (PHI) 
in text documents using pattern matching and regular expressions.

### Key Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with healthcare data standards and HIPAA requirements
- Developed understanding of the challenges in automated sensitive data detection
- Explored regex pattern matching for various PHI formats (SSN, MRN, dates, etc.)
- Learned why enterprise-grade DLP solutions require sophisticated ML approaches

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Python development for text processing
- Regular expression pattern design
- Healthcare domain knowledge application
- Git version control and project documentation

### Note
This was a learning project and is not intended for production use. For actual PHI 
detection needs, please use certified healthcare compliance tools.
